KSP-2 RECREATIONS
Repository built around saving .json files of KSP-2 recreations of real world rockets.
Form and function are meant to be kept intact. A V2 rocket recreation should be suborbital, while maintaining the form factor of the real world version.

Scale is what is able to be played with. Basically, so long as a screenshot makes it look close, and it can carry payloads to orbit, it's good.
As new features get added futuristic rocket designs will be added, like the ISV Venture Star, but for now we're limited to 2000s technology.
Have fun! Use whatever tricks you need to make it work :)
